## WARNING - Risk of electric shock!

Incorrect repairs are dangerous.

- Repairs to the appliance should only be carried out by trained specialist staff.
- Only use genuine spare parts when repairing the appliance.
- If the power cord of this appliance is damaged, it must be replaced by the manufacturer, the manufacturer's Customer Service or a similarly qualified person in order to prevent any risk.

An ingress of moisture can cause an electric shock.

- Do not use steam- or high-pressure cleaners, hoses or sprays to clean the appliance.

![Image](manual_bosch_WGG254Z0GR-parsed-w-imgs_artifacts/image_000020_7f60f6231eed28ec4de291147129c70e86fdeb6fdf6290821bac4dd6b25f9188.png)

## WARNING - Risk of injury!

The use of non-original spare parts and non-original accessories is dangerous.

![Image](manual_bosch_WGG254Z0GR-parsed-w-imgs_artifacts/image_000021_509cb34565bd9209d88d4b7d0853ba31bf7e0da67e8198decfafa366aa281a1a.png)

## WARNING - Risk of poisoning!

Poisonous fumes may be given off if you use cleaning agents that contain solvents.

- Do not use cleaning agents that contain solvents.

## 2 Preventing material damage

## ATTENTION!

The functionality of the appliance may be impaired if you use the wrong quantity of fabric softener, detergent, care product or cleaning agent.

- Follow the dosage recommenda-
- tions from the manufacturer. Exceeding the maximum load capa-

city impairs the function of the appliance.

- Observe the maximum load capacity for each programme and do not exceed it.
- → "Programmes", Page 25

The appliance is secured for transportation using transit bolts. Transit bolts which have not been removed may result in material damage and damage to the appliance.

- Before starting up the appliance, remove the transit bolts completely and keep them in a safe place.
- Before transport, fit the transit bolts fully in order to prevent damage in transit.

Material damage may be caused if the water inlet hose is connected incorrectly.

- Tighten the screw connections on the water inlet until they are handtight.
- Ideally, connect the water inlet hose directly to the water tap, without any additional connecting elements such as adapters, extensions, valves or similar.
- Ensure that the inner diameter of the water tap is at least 17 mm.
- Make sure that the length of the thread on the connection to the water tap is at least 10 mm.

If the water pressure is too high or too low, the appliance may not be able to operate properly.

- Ensure that the water pressure in the water supply system is at least 100 kPa (1 bar) and max. 1000 kPa (10 bar).
- If the water pressure exceeds the maximum value specified, a pressure-reducing valve must be installed between the drinking water connection and the hose set of the appliance.
- Do not connect the appliance to the mixer tap of an unpressurised hot-water boiler.

Modified or damaged water hoses may result in material damage and damage to the appliance.

- Never kink, crush, modify or cut through water hoses.
- Only use the water hoses supplied with the appliance or genuine spare hoses.
- Never re-use water hoses that have been used before.

Operating the appliance using water that is dirty or too hot may lead to material damage and damage to the appliance.

- Only operate the appliance with cold mains water.

Unsuitable cleaning products may damage the surfaces of the appliance.

- Do not use harsh or abrasive detergents.
- Do not use cleaning products with a high alcohol content.
- Do not use hard scouring pads or cleaning sponges.
- Clean the appliance with nothing but water and a soft, damp cloth.
- Remove all detergent residue, spray residue or other residues immediately if they come into contact with the appliance.

## 3 Environmental protection and saving energy

## 3.1 Disposing of packaging

The packaging materials are environmentally compatible and can be recycled.

- Sort the individual components by type and dispose of them separately.

## 3.2 Save energy and conserve resources

If you follow these instructions, your appliance will use less electricity and less water.

Choose programmes with low temperatures and longer wash times and use maximum load capacity.

- a Energy consumption and water consumption is most efficient.

Add detergent based on the laundry's degree of soiling.

- a For light to normal soiling, a smaller amount of detergent is sufficient. Observe the dosage recommendation from the detergent manufacturer.

Reduce the washing temperature for lightly and normally soiled laundry.

- a At lower temperatures, the appliance consumes less energy. For light to normal soiling, lower temperatures than indicated on the care label are also sufficient.

Set the maximum spin speed if you want to dry the laundry in the tumble dryer afterwards.

- a The drier the laundry, the shorter the programme duration when drying which, in turn, reduces energy consumption. A higher spin speed reduces the residual moisture in the laundry and increases the volume of the spin noise.

Wash the laundry without prewash.

- a Washing with prewash increases the programme duration and increases energy and water consumption.

The appliance has a continuous automatic load adjustment function.

- a Depending on the type of fabric and load capacity, the continuous automatic load adjustment function optimally adjusts the water consumption and programme duration.

## 3.3 Energy saving mode

If you do not use the appliance for an extended period, it automatically switches to energy-saving mode. Energy-saving mode ends when you use the appliance again.

## 4 Installation and connection

## 4.1 Unpacking the appliance

## ATTENTION!

Objects remaining in the drum that are not designed for operation with the appliance may cause material damage and damage to the appliance.

- Remove these objects, along with all supplied accessories, from the drum before starting the appliance.
1. Remove any packaging and protective covers completely from the appliance.
- → "Disposing of packaging", Page 11
2. Check the appliance for visible damage.
3. Open the door.
4. Remove any accessories from the drum.
5. Close the door.

## 4.2 Contents of package

After unpacking all parts, check for any damage in transit and completeness of the delivery.

## ATTENTION!

If the appliance is operated with incomplete or defective accessories, the appliance may not be able to operate properly, or this may result in material damage or damage to the appliance.

- Do not operate the appliance with incomplete or defective accessories.
- Replace the accessories in question before operating the appliance.
- → "Accessories", Page 29

Note: The appliance has been tested at the factory to check it is in working order. As a result, water stains may remain in the appliance. These marks will disappear after the first wash cycle.
